## Central & State Subsidy Structures

### National Subsidy Framework (PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana)
The central government provides **direct benefit transfers** under a tiered system[1][3][5]:

| System Capacity | Subsidy Amount | % of System Cost |
|------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| ≤2 kW            | ₹30,000/kW     | 60%               |
| 3 kW             | ₹78,000 fixed  | 40% (on incremental 1kW)|
| >3 kW            | ₹78,000 fixed  | -                 |

**Special category states** (Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, etc.) receive **20% higher subsidies**:
- ₹20,000/kW for ≤3 kW systems
- ₹10,000/kW for 4–10 kW systems[3][5]

## Future Policy Directions (2025–2030)

1. **Subsidy Expansion**: Proposed increase to ₹1.5 lakh for 5kW systems under Phase-III[3]
2. **Battery Incentives**: 10% additional subsidy for systems with ≥3kWh storage[5]
3. **EV Integration**: ₹15,000 rebate for solar-powered EV charging stations[4]

_This analysis synthesizes data from MNRE guidelines[6], state DISCOM portals[3], and subsidy tracking reports[5]. Individual savings may vary based on local irradiation (3.5–6.5 kWh/m²/day) and tariff structures._
