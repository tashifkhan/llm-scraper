## Central Subsidy Framework (PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana)
| System Capacity | Subsidy Amount (₹) | % of System Cost Covered |
|------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Up to 2 kW       | ₹30,000/kW          | 60%                       |
| 3 kW             | ₹78,000 fixed       | 40%                       |
| Above 3 kW       | ₹78,000 fixed       | -                         |

### National Subsidy Framework (PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana)
The central government provides
**direct benefit transfers** under a tiered system[1][3][5]:

**Special category states** (Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, etc.) receive **20% higher subsidies**:
- ₹20,000/kW for ≤3 kW systems
- ₹10,000/kW for 4–10 kW systems [3][5]
- Maximum subsidy: ₹1,30,000

## Future Policy Directions (2025–2030)

1. **Subsidy Expansion**: Proposed increase to ₹1.5 lakh for 5kW systems under Phase-III[3]
2. **Battery Incentives**: 10% additional subsidy for systems with ≥3kWh storage[5]
3. **EV Integration**: ₹15,000 rebate for solar-powered EV charging stations[4]

_This analysis synthesizes data from MNRE guidelines[6], state DISCOM portals[3], and subsidy tracking reports[5]. Individual savings may vary based on local irradiation (3.5–6.5 kWh/m²/day) and tariff structures._
