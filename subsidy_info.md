### National Subsidy Framework (PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana)
The central government provides
**direct benefit transfers** under a tiered system[1][3][5]:

**Special category states** (Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, etc.) receive **20% higher subsidies**:
- ₹20,000/kW for ≤3 kW systems
- ₹10,000/kW for 4–10 kW systems [3][5]
- Maximum subsidy: ₹1,30,000
